      "The world will lose its meaning in the absence of music. There is a vast treasure trove of music exists in the world. Out of all the harmony and melodious kind of music, Hindustani Classical one has always fascinated me with its essence and beauty. According to Hindu mythology, music originated from the very sound of “Om.” However, it has historically adopted and evolved with many regional styles, it has two major traditions. That is where in the midst of all this tunefulness,Hindustani Classical Music comes into being. It is also known as North Indian style of Indian classical music as it is indigenous to North. Then, the two pillars of the very essence of classical music comes into picture- the Raag and the Taal.Raga is the beauty and tala is the enhancer of this beauty. Raga relates to the melody. It is the euphonic foundation to the system. The melodic mode or raga is sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala. The whole rhythmic organization is based on the various kinds of rhythmic patterns. A raga consists of these basic seven notes. Any composition or any piece of music will be sung depending on these seven notes. They are Sa (Shadhja), Re (Rishabh), Ga (Gandhar), Ma (Madhyam), Pa (Pancham), Dha (Dhaivat), Ni (Nishad).",

      "Mithila painting (or Madhubani art) is a style of painting practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. Artists create these paintings using a variety of mediums, including their own fingers, or twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks. The paint is created using natural dyes and pigments. The paintings are characterised by their eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.",

      "In the ancient Sanskrit language of Hinduism and Buddhism, mandala means “circle.” Traditionally, a mandala is a geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds. “It’s all about finding peace in the symmetry of the design and of the universe,” says artist Saudamini Madra. People in different cultures all over the world have created mandalas, suggesting that the form speaks to something deep within every human being. The brilliant psychoanalyst Carl Jung believed that the mandala represents the Self and that drawing a mandala gives a person a sacred space to meet that Self. He considered making mandalas an effective form of art therapy, helping to calm and comfort people struggling with mental health issues.",

      "Some kids love veggies and devour kale salad without blinking an eye. Others run screaming from a carrot stick. But with a few tricks, you can make every meal more wholesome and nourishing for the whole family. Here are 10 somewhat sneaky, but still delicious, ways to encourage eaters, big and small, to love those veggies. 1. BLEND A BETTER BATTER - The next time you whip up batter for a batch of pancakes or waffles, go green … or orange, or pink! In a high-speed blender, add a couple of handfuls of fresh baby spinach, or a cup of either cooked beets or pumpkin puree (canned works well) to the wet ingredients. Worried about “earthy” undertones? Add a little extra vanilla and cinnamon.  2. MAXIMIZE MUFFINS - You can pack a whole lot of nutrients into one mighty little muffin! Add shredded carrot to your favorite spice, apple, or bran muffin recipe for some natural sweetness. Shredded zucchini can bump up the benefits of chocolate-based muffins; just make sure to squeeze the excess water out of the zucchini before folding into the batter.  3. SUPERFOOD SMOOTHIES - Perhaps the quickest way to get a hefty dose of greens directly to veggie haters is in a tall glass. Try a simple and sweet combination of baby greens (like spinach and kale), banana, pitted dates, almond butter, low-fat milk, and ice.  4. EGGS WITH, WELL, EVERYTHING - Almost all vegetables are even better when sautéed and mixed with a scrambled egg. You can also combine spinach with eggs in a blender before scrambling for a “green eggs” themed meal, or whisk together eggs and veggie purees (cooked and cooled) such as squash, carrot, or cauliflower.  5. CAULIFLOWER POWER - Cauliflower is so versatile, and it’s really good at standing in for other carbs. For cauliflower “rice,” steam a head of cauliflower until al dente, then shred on a box grater-shredder, or blitz in a food processor until it forms small, rice-sized pieces. Sauté gently in a little broth and serve as is, or mix with cooked white rice. For cauliflower mash, steam ’til soft, then push through a potato ricer, or process in a food processor until smooth. Mix with a little chicken broth or milk, and season to taste.  6. ZOODLES AND VOODLES - Turning veggies into noodles definitely needs to happen at your house. The first and most popular version is zucchini noodles (“zoodles”), but you can use carrots, sweet potatoes, and other squash, too. It’s pretty easy when you get the hang of it; simply use a spiralizer or veggie peeler to make long ribbons, and sauté in your favorite sauce.  7. MAGIC MEATLOAF AND MEATBALLS - It’s so easy to pack any vegetable under the sun into meatloaf or meatballs. Try minced mushrooms, shredded onion and carrots, and finely chopped leafy greens, in addition to traditional seasonings. For a meatball recipe that rolls well with any noodles or zoodles, try mixing ground turkey with an egg or two, spices (dried oregano or basil work well), grated Parmesan cheese, minced spinach, and shredded zucchini.  8. BITE-SIZE VEGGIE PIZZAS - Use mushroom caps and zucchini rounds instead of dough for a fresh spin on pizza night. Simply bake mushroom caps and zucchini rounds in the oven for 10 to 15  minutes, then top each with a teaspoon of sauce and a pinch of cheese. Serve these bite-size pizzas alongside homemade meatballs, olives, and whole-wheat breadsticks.  9. MAC AND CHEESE, LEVELED UP - Adding veggies to macaroni and cheese is a winner of a dinner for kids of all ages. Chop up baby spinach and mix into your cheese sauce for a green-flecked dish, or for something more incognito, stir pureed veggies into the sauce (butternut squash hides well).  10. A SMARTER SNACK PLATTER - On weekends, when kids and grown-ups fall into the mindless-eating trap, set out a platter of veggie sticks with a few dips. Any time someone is hungry, they can find a flavor combo with crunch. Try carrots and tahini, celery and nut butter, green beans and honey mustard, bell peppers and hummus, broccoli and a ranch yogurt dip, or cucumbers and Italian dressing.",

      "The Vampire Diaries focuses on a group of teens and their deep family ties to the small town of Mystic Falls, with its supernatural history. The story centers around Elena Gilbert. Once the most popular girl in school, she suffered a lot after the death of her parents a few months prior to the show's start and is now living with her young aunt Jenna and brother Jeremy. Elena's world is then turned upside down, even more, when she meets the mysterious new guy at school, Stefan Salvatore and his brother Damon. The return of Salvatore brothers, both vampires, opens the door to the town’s supernatural past. But Stefan and Damon have another secret... After meeting Elena, they realize she bears a striking resemblance to the girl they both loved and died trying to save back in 1864 - Katherine Pierce. The brothers each try to get close to Elena to find out why she is so familiar-looking, resulting in both falling in love with her in the process. The show also focuses on Elena’s two best friends, Bonnie Bennett (a witch) and Caroline Forbes, along with Elena's brother Jeremy, her ex-boyfriend Matt Donovan, and the mayor’s son Tyler Lockwood. Most of the teens are decedents of the founding families of Mystic Falls, a heritage kept alive through a secret council whose goal is to eradicate the town of all supernatural creatures.",

      "In the 1900s, the first usable acrylic resin was discovered at a chemical company in Germany. Acrylic resin quickly transformed into an all-purpose paint as it combined the properties of oil and watercolours, giving birth to a new and improved pigment formula. In the early years of its discovery, acrylic resin was primarily utilised for industrial purposes. However, in the mid 20th century, several artists such as Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, and more, started using acrylic paints as an artistic medium. Taking inspiration from these legends, many painters embraced acrylic as a medium, and soon ushered the era of commercial acrylic artwork. One of the best features of acrylic colour paintings is that they are long-lasting and do not wear off easily, even with moderate light exposure. Due to their artistic texture and appeal, acrylic paintings have now become a significant part of home decor, museums collections and art galleries.",
